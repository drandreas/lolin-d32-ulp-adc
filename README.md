# Lolin D32 Battery Voltage Measurement

This sample demonstrates how the ULP ADC can also be used to measure the
battery voltage.

## Input Calibration
I assume that the Main CPUs ADC and the ULPs ADC are different parts of the Silicon, since the Voltage measurements on my unit do not match.

| Batt   | uC ADC | ULP ADC |
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| 4300mV |   2415 |    2480 |
| 3600mV |   1990 |    2058 |
| 3200mV |   1744 |    1801 |
| 2600mV |   1354 |    1399 |

For the single cell Li-Ion Battery the voltage-range of 3.2V to 4.3V is the most relevant, I've therefore decided to optimize my conversion for this range.

Iâ€™ve formulated the following two linear equations to calculate the steepness (a) and offset (b) of the line.
```
a * 2480 + b = 4300mV
a * 1801 + b = 3200mV
```

Solving the equation-system results in
```
a = 1100/679   = ~1659/1024
b = 191700/679 = ~282
```

## Implementing Multiplication and Division using shift operations
Multiplications of arbitrary values can be implemented as a combination of left shifts and addtions.
Divisions can only be implemented for powers of two (1, 2, 4, 16, 32, ...).

Multiplying the ADC input by 1100/679 can be approximated by 1659/1024 and implemented on the ULP as:
```
raw = adc(0, 8);

new_voltage  = raw;
new_voltage += raw >> 1;
new_voltage += raw >> 4;
new_voltage += raw >> 5;
new_voltage += raw >> 6;
new_voltage += raw >> 7;
new_voltage += raw >> 9;
new_voltage += raw >> 10;
```

## Validation

I've validated the ADC output for 0.1V increments:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 4.3V  | 4.301  |
| 4.2V  | 4.199  |
| 4.1V  | 4.100  |
| 4.0V  | 4.005  |
| 3.9V  | 3.905  |
| 3.8V  | 3.810  |
| 3.7V  | 3.710  |
| 3.6V  | 3.618  |
| 3.5V  | 3.504  |
| 3.4V  | 3.406  |
| 3.3V  | 3.305  |
| 3.2V  | 3.194  |
| 3.1V  | 3.087  |
| 3.0V  | 2.984  |
